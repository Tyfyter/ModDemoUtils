This mod allows other modders to set up worlds to demonstrate features of their mods or serve as tutorials, and provides helpful items and blocks for such worlds

How to use:

As a player:
Simply enable this mod alongside another mod which uses it, and open that mod's demo worlds through the in-game mods menu;
If a demo provides a Guide Lens, it can be used to see Guide Blocks - which may mark paths or points of interest - by holding it or enabling it in your info accessories
